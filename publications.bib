abstractNote={This paper explores the energy-saving potential of a spatial, single-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) Bennett mechanism in industrial pick-and-place tasks. In comparison to conventional robotic arms with multiple actuators, Bennett’s mechanism uses a closed kinematic structure and a single actuator to realize complicated spatial trajectories. Through both simulation and experimental comparison with a commercial UR3e collaborative robot, the mechatronic prototype of the Bennett mechanism demonstrated a reduction in energy consumption of up to 92% for identical tasks. The results confirm that closed loop mechanisms can be an energy-efficient option for tasks with simple, repetitive motion. While the Bennett mechanism is limited to predefined trajectories, its simplicity, low energy footprint, and suitability for repetitive tasks make it a promising alternative for dedicated automation scenarios. This study underscores the value of low-redundancy kinematic designs in future industrial robotics.},

volume={192},

DOI={10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2023.105545}, 
abstractNote={Hydraulic actuators convert fluid pressure into mechanical motion. They are widely used in many industrial and aerospace applications due to their reliability, high speed, high force output, smooth operation, and shock compensation ability. Because of their importance and wide adoption, it is vital to enable precise modeling of such devices. Fortunately, various modeling methods exist for hydraulic actuators and hydraulically driven systems, ranging from lookup tables or simple equations reflecting the system’s main features using lumped fluid theory to sophisticated and realistic fluid dynamics models. However, accurately accounting for friction that can depend nonlinearly on several state variables remains a core challenge in achieving high-fidelity hydraulic modeling. Therefore, several computational friction models are available, and their parameters must be identified or guessed. Another concern refers to simulation efficiency when complex models are considered. This study introduces a data-driven surrogate based on deep neural networks to address the challenge of practical and effective modeling of friction in hydraulic actuators. The surrogate is trained as a predictor using synthetic data generated from LuGre friction, demonstrating excellent accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract="The analysis and solution of many modern flexible multibody dynamic problems require formulations that are able to effectively model bodies with nonlinear materials undergoing large displacements and deformations. The absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) in connection with a continuum-based approach is one way to deal with these systems. The main objective of this work is to extend an existent approach for the modelling of slender structures within the ANCF framework with nonlinear, nearly incompressible materials using the volumetric energy penalty technique. The main part of the study is devoted to the evaluation of multi-layer beam models and simplifications in the locking suppression method based on F-bar projection. The results present significantly better agreement with the reference solution for multi-layer structures built with the standard ANCF beam element as compared with the earlier implementation.",
