title={Reducing Energy Consumption in Robotic Processes Using a Single-DOF Bennett Mechanism},

DOI={10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3646349}, 
abstractNote={This paper explores the energy-saving potential of a spatial, single-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) Bennett mechanism in industrial pick-and-place tasks. In comparison to conventional robotic arms with multiple actuators, Bennett’s mechanism uses a closed kinematic structure and a single actuator to realize complicated spatial trajectories. Through both simulation and experimental comparison with a commercial UR3e collaborative robot, the mechatronic prototype of the Bennett mechanism demonstrated a reduction in energy consumption of up to 92% for identical tasks. The results confirm that closed loop mechanisms can be an energy-efficient option for tasks with simple, repetitive motion. While the Bennett mechanism is limited to predefined trajectories, its simplicity, low energy footprint, and suitability for repetitive tasks make it a promising alternative for dedicated automation scenarios. This study underscores the value of low-redundancy kinematic designs in future industrial robotics.},

volume={192}, 
ISSN={0094-114X}, 
DOI={10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2023.105545}, 
abstractNote={Hydraulic actuators convert fluid pressure into mechanical motion. They are widely used in many industrial and aerospace applications due to their reliability, high speed, high force output, smooth operation, and shock compensation ability. Because of their importance and wide adoption, it is vital to enable precise modeling of such devices. Fortunately, various modeling methods exist for hydraulic actuators and hydraulically driven systems, ranging from lookup tables or simple equations reflecting the system’s main features using lumped fluid theory to sophisticated and realistic fluid dynamics models. However, accurately accounting for friction that can depend nonlinearly on several state variables remains a core challenge in achieving high-fidelity hydraulic modeling. Therefore, several computational friction models are available, and their parameters must be identified or guessed. Another concern refers to simulation efficiency when complex models are considered. This study introduces a data-driven surrogate based on deep neural networks to address the challenge of practical and effective modeling of friction in hydraulic actuators. The surrogate is trained as a predictor using synthetic data generated from LuGre friction, demonstrating excellent accuracy and efficiency.},
