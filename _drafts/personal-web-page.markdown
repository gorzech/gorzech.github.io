In this first short entry, I will write why I decide to make this web page. And why I think it is worth considering to have such a space as an academic researcher. 

## Discussion with friends 

As with many decisions, the idea of having a web page that will contain your data, section about, achievements, and similar, crosses my mind many time. This time three things has crossed together to make this came true: recent expierience with Jekyll and GitHub Pages (due to need to publish only some extra resuts for the paper), process of applying for a tenure-trach position, and discussion with my friends.

## Why to have and why not to have a webpage

In the next paragraph I will try to show some reasons to find a need for a webpage. The last topic, of the fears, is broad. I cannot comment on it broadly because of the lack of expertise. I can just pinpoint some things that I know from expierience or have heard around enought time to sound plausible. Plus common sense. One big issue may be a worry to have our thoughts exposed to others and someone may really dislike them. And everyone have heard about the hate in the Internet. Another, related fears, may deal with feeling on being stupid, wrong or irrelevant. Who am I to show what I have done? Well at least I have already show to the word some of my doings by writing papers. However, I cannot argue if any kind of the fear came into existance. This is individual and sensitive zone. I would say that if such webpage achieve any of the goals pointed in below, it is worth having one.

So, why to consider to have a webpage? 

even if only one person would find this page useful it is worth it. Or if you will get one person contacting you to find a helping hand. But, let me continue to a reasont
